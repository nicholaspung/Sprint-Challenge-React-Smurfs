1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Client-side routing is when the website you are on does the routing to the different pages of the website. Server-side routing is when the website you are on triggers a different route from the back-end server to then route the front-end website to a different page.

    Server-side routing: requesting a new page from the server when clicking on a link
    Client-side routing: route is handled internally by the Javascript that is loaded on the page
